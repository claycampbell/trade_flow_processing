# Technical Context

## Technologies Used
- **Kafka**: For event streaming and message brokering.
- **Kafka Streams**: For real-time processing of input events.
- **Java**: Primary programming language for implementing microservices and Kafka Streams.
- **Spring Boot**: Framework for building microservices.
- **In-Memory Data Stores**: Such as Redis or Hazelcast for temporary data storage and state management.
- **Docker**: For containerizing microservices.
- **Kubernetes**: For orchestrating and managing containerized microservices.

## Development Setup
1. **Development Environment**:
   - Install Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher.
   - Set up Apache Kafka and Kafka Streams.
   - Use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA or VSCode.
   - Set up Docker and Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration.

2. **Project Structure**:
   - **src/**: Source code for microservices.
   - **config/**: Configuration files for Kafka, Kafka Streams, and microservices.
   - **docker/**: Dockerfiles for containerizing microservices.
   - **k8s/**: Kubernetes deployment and service files.

3. **Build and Deployment**:
   - Use Maven or Gradle for building the project.
   - Use Docker to build container images.
   - Deploy microservices to Kubernetes using Helm charts or Kubernetes manifests.

## Technical Constraints
- **In-Memory Computations**: All computations must be performed in-memory to avoid database usage.
- **Real-Time Processing**: The system must process trade events in real-time with minimal latency.
- **Scalability**: The architecture must be able to scale horizontally to handle increasing volumes of trade events.
- **Fault Tolerance**: The system must be fault-tolerant and able to recover from failures without data loss.

## Dependencies
- **Spring Boot**: For building microservices.
- **Kafka Clients**: For integrating with Kafka and Kafka Streams.
- **In-Memory Data Store Clients**: For integrating with Redis or Hazelcast.
- **Docker**: For containerization.
- **Kubernetes**: For orchestration and management of containers.
- **Prometheus and Grafana**: For monitoring and visualization.
- **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)**: For centralized logging and log analysis.
