# Project Progress

## Completed Tasks
- Created basic project structure with directories for:
  - src/config: Configuration files
  - docker: Docker-related files
  - k8s: Kubernetes manifests
- Implemented initial microservices structure
- Created Spring Boot configuration files for all services

- Implemented Trade Validation Service:
  - Trade model and validation rules
  - Validation service with rule orchestration
  - Spring configuration for validation rules
  - Kafka integration for message processing
  - Error handling and retries

- Implemented Trade Enrichment Service:
  - Redis caching configuration
  - Generic cache service
  - Data enrichment models
  - Trade enrichment with caching
  - Configurable TTLs for different data types

- Implemented Trade Simulation Engine:
  - Scheduled trade generation
  - Random trade data generation
  - REST API for simulation control
  - Burst mode for load testing
  - Configurable generation parameters
  - Health monitoring endpoints
  - Thread-safe state management

## In Progress
- Implementing metrics collection:
  - Trade generation rates
  - Processing success/failure rates
  - System performance metrics
  - Cache hit ratios

## Next Steps
1. Implement monitoring and visualization:
   - Real-time trade flow dashboard
   - System performance graphs
   - Error rate monitoring
   - Cache statistics visualization

2. Enhance simulation capabilities:
   - Market condition simulation
   - Error scenario injection
   - Price movement patterns
   - Trade correlations
   - Market events simulation

3. Create Docker containers and deployment:
   - Create Dockerfiles
   - Set up container orchestration
   - Configure service discovery
   - Implement scaling policies

## Known Issues
- Need to implement proper error handling for external service failures
- Cache eviction policies need to be fine-tuned
- Performance testing needed for cache configurations
- Simulation rate limiting needs optimization
- Need more realistic price movements

## Technical Decisions
- Using Strategy pattern for validation rules
- Implementing validation rules as Spring beans
- Using dependency injection for validation rule configuration
- Centralized exception handling for validation errors
- Redis for distributed caching with TTLs
- Kafka for message processing and integration
- Separate topics for different message types
- Retry mechanisms with backoff policies
- Scheduled tasks for trade simulation
- REST API for simulation control
- Thread-safe simulation state management
