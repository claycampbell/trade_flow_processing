# Project Progress

## Completed Tasks
- Created basic project structure with directories for:
  - src/config: Configuration files
  - docker: Docker-related files
  - k8s: Kubernetes manifests
- Implemented initial microservices structure
- Created Spring Boot configuration files for all services
- Implemented Trade Validation Service core components:
  - Trade model and validation rules
  - Validation service with rule orchestration
  - Spring configuration for validation rules
- Implemented Kafka integration for Trade Validation Service:
  - Message model for Kafka events
  - Kafka configuration with retry support
  - Message listener with error handling
  - Configurable topics and consumer groups

## In Progress
- Setting up data persistence configurations:
  - Redis for Trade Enrichment Service
  - MongoDB for Trade Aggregation Service
- Implementing Trade Enrichment Service
- Implementing Trade Aggregation Service

## Next Steps
1. Implement Redis caching in Trade Enrichment Service
2. Configure MongoDB persistence in Trade Aggregation Service
3. Create Docker containers for each service
4. Set up monitoring and metrics collection

## Known Issues
- None currently identified

## Technical Decisions
- Using Strategy pattern for validation rules
- Implementing validation rules as Spring beans
- Using dependency injection for validation rule configuration
- Centralized exception handling for validation errors
- Kafka retry mechanism with backoff policy
- Separate topics for retryable and non-retryable messages
