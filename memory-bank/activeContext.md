# Active Development Context

## Current Focus
Implementing system testing capabilities with trade simulation.

## Recent Changes
1. Implemented Trade Simulation Engine:
   - Scheduled trade generation
   - Random trade data generation
   - Configurable generation intervals
   - Burst mode for load testing
   - REST API for control

2. Simulation Features:
   - Multiple instruments and counterparties
   - Realistic price and quantity ranges
   - Configurable enable/disable
   - Health monitoring endpoints
   - Rate limiting support

3. Previous Implementations:
   - Redis caching in Trade Enrichment Service
   - Kafka integration in Trade Validation Service
   - Core validation rules and processing

## Technical Decisions
1. Simulation Design:
   - REST API for control and monitoring
   - Scheduled generation using Spring
   - Thread-safe state management
   - Configurable generation parameters
   - Built-in rate limiting

2. Data Generation:
   - Realistic instrument codes
   - Major currencies only
   - Common counterparties
   - Price ranges within normal bounds
   - Random but reasonable quantities

3. Integration:
   - Direct Kafka production
   - No persistence of generated trades
   - Health check endpoints
   - Status monitoring
   - Configurable via application.yaml

## Next Steps
1. Implement metrics collection:
   - Trade generation rates
   - Processing success/failure rates
   - System performance metrics
   - Cache hit ratios

2. Add visualization dashboard:
   - Real-time trade flow
   - System performance graphs
   - Error rate monitoring
   - Cache statistics

3. Enhance simulation capabilities:
   - More complex trade scenarios
   - Market condition simulation
   - Error scenario injection
   - Performance stress testing

## Active Considerations
- Need to implement more realistic price movements
- Consider adding market volatility simulation
- Plan for distributed load testing
- Consider implementing trade correlations
- Need to add error scenario simulation
- Consider implementing market events
