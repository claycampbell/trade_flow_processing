# Product Context

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to design an event-driven microservices architecture for trade flow processing. This architecture will leverage Kafka Streams for input events and ensure that all computations are performed in-memory, avoiding the use of traditional databases.

## Problem Statement
In the financial industry, trade flow processing requires real-time handling of large volumes of trade events. Traditional database systems can introduce latency and become bottlenecks in high-frequency trading environments. There is a need for a scalable and efficient architecture that can process trade events in real-time without relying on databases.

## Solution
The proposed solution is an event-driven microservices architecture that uses Kafka Streams for processing trade events. By performing all computations in-memory, the architecture will achieve high performance and low latency. Each microservice will handle specific parts of the trade flow, ensuring modularity and scalability.

## User Experience Goals
- **Real-Time Processing**: Ensure that trade events are processed in real-time with minimal latency.
- **Scalability**: Design the architecture to handle increasing volumes of trade events without performance degradation.
- **Reliability**: Ensure that the system is fault-tolerant and can recover from failures without data loss.
- **Maintainability**: Create a modular architecture that is easy to maintain and extend.

## Key Features
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Use Kafka for event streaming and message brokering.
- **In-Memory Computations**: Perform all computations in-memory to achieve high performance.
- **Microservices**: Implement microservices to handle specific parts of the trade flow.
- **Scalability**: Design the system to scale horizontally by adding more instances of microservices.

## Stakeholders
- **Project Manager**: Oversees the project and ensures it meets business objectives.
- **Development Team**: Implements the architecture and microservices.
- **QA Team**: Tests the system to ensure it meets performance and reliability requirements.
- **Operations Team**: Manages the deployment and monitoring of the system.

## Success Criteria
- Successful implementation of the event-driven microservices architecture.
- Real-time processing of trade events with low latency.
- Efficient in-memory computations without database usage.
- Scalability to handle increasing volumes of trade events.
