# Project Brief

## Project Title
Event-Driven Microservices Architecture for Trade Flow Processing

## Core Requirements and Goals
- Design an event-driven microservices architecture for trade flow processing.
- Utilize Kafka Streams for input events.
- Ensure all computations are performed in-memory, avoiding database usage.

## Scope
This project aims to create a scalable and efficient architecture for processing trade flow events in real-time. The architecture will leverage Kafka Streams for event processing and ensure that all computations are performed in-memory to achieve high performance and low latency.

## Key Components
1. **Kafka**: For event streaming and message brokering.
2. **Kafka Streams**: For processing the input events in real-time.
3. **Microservices**: Each microservice will handle specific parts of the trade flow.
4. **In-Memory Data Stores**: For temporary data storage and state management.

## Objectives
- Implement a robust and scalable event-driven architecture.
- Ensure real-time processing of trade events.
- Maintain high performance by using in-memory computations.
- Avoid the use of traditional databases for state management.

## Deliverables
- Detailed architectural design document.
- Implementation plan for microservices.
- Configuration and setup instructions for Kafka and Kafka Streams.
- In-memory data store setup and management guidelines.

## Timeline
- Week 1: Architectural design and documentation.
- Week 2: Implementation of microservices and Kafka Streams integration.
- Week 3: Testing and performance optimization.
- Week 4: Final review and documentation.

## Stakeholders
- Project Manager
- Development Team
- QA Team
- Operations Team

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: High memory usage due to in-memory computations.
  - **Mitigation**: Implement efficient memory management and garbage collection strategies.
- **Risk**: Potential bottlenecks in Kafka Streams processing.
  - **Mitigation**: Optimize Kafka Streams configuration and scaling.

## Success Criteria
- Successful implementation of the event-driven microservices architecture.
- Real-time processing of trade events with low latency.
- Efficient in-memory computations without database usage.
